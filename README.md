# Shopping-Cart-System-in-C++
 The core algorithms used in the implementation include: add_new_Item: Adds a new item to the shopping cart. It checks if the item already exists in the cart  based on its ID and updates the quantity if it does. Otherwise, it creates a new item node and adds it to  the cart. removeing_Item: Removes an item from the shopping cart based on its ID. It traverses the linked list to  find and remove the item node with the specified ID. update_Quantity_info: Updates the quantity of an existing item in the cart. It traverses the list to find  the item node with the specified ID and modifies its quantity. calculate_Total_Price: Calculates the total price of all items in the shopping cart by multiplying the  price of each item by its quantity and summing them. display_Cart_list: Displays the contents of the shopping cart, including the ID, name, price, and  quantity of each item. It also calculates and prints the total price of all items in the cart.
